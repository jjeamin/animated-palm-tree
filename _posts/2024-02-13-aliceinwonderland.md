최근에 영어를 본격적으로 공부하기 위해 Madeleine 이라는 영어 친구를 사귀게 되었다. 그녀와 함께 시작한 Alice in Wonderland 원서 읽기를 모두와 함께 공유하려고 한다. 그녀가 나에게 준 만큼 그대로 보답하도록 하자.

한영 번역은 CHATGPT와 함께 진행했고, 실제 Madeleine이 어느 부분에서 이 글이 잘써졌다는지 알려주는 것을 공유하려한다.

 **English**: CHAPTER 1 DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE

 **Korean**: 챕터 1 토끼굴로 내려가다.

> Madeleine과 RABBIT HOLE에 대해서 이야기를 했다. RABBIT HOLE은 토끼가 파놓은 굴이라는 뜻이다. 실제 RABBIT HOLE은 Business English 에서는 메인 주제가 아닌 다른 이야기에 빠져든다는 뜻으로도 사용된다고 한다.

**English**: Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading. But it had no pictures or conversations in it, "and what is the use of a book," thought Alice, "without pictures or conversations?"

**Korean**: 앨리스는 자매와 강가에 앉아 있는 것이 너무 지겨워지기 시작했고, 할 일이 아무것도 없다는 것에 지쳤다. 한두 번 자매가 읽고 있는 책을 훔쳐보긴 했었다. 하지만 그 책에는 그림이나 대화가 전혀 없었다. "그림이나 대화 없는 책이 무슨 쓸모가 있지?"라고 앨리스는 생각했다.

> 이 문구에서 bank는 은행뿐만 아니라 강가 옆에 있는 둑을 나타내기도 한다. 추가로 여기에서 그림과 대화가 없는 책을 지루해하는 것으로 보아 엘리스가 어린아이라는 것을 알 수 있다.

**English**: So she was considering in her own mind, (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid,) whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.

**Korean**: 그래서 그녀는 혼자서 생각하고 있었다. (날씨가 더워서 졸리고 멍한 상태였지만,) 데이지를 따서 데이지 체인을 만드는 즐거움이 일어나서 데이지를 따는 수고를 감수할 가치가 있는지에 대해서, 그런데 갑자기 분홍색 눈을 가진 하얀색 토끼가 그녀 근처를 달려가는 것이었습니다.

> 이 문구는 그녀가 내면 깊은 곳에 점점 빠져들고 있다는 것을 암시한다.

---

**English**: There was nothing so very remarkable in that: nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, "Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!" (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waist-coat-pocket or a watch to take out of it, and, burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.

**Korean**: 그런 일이 그렇게 놀라운 일은 아니었고, 앨리스도 토끼가 혼잣말로 "아이고! 아이고! 나 너무 늦을 거야!"라고 말하는 것이 그렇게 이상하게 생각하지 않았습니다. (나중에 생각해보면 그런 일에 대해 놀라워했어야 했을 것이라는 생각이 들었지만, 당시에는 그 모든 것이 자연스럽게 느껴졌습니다.) 하지만 토끼가 정말로 허리띠 주머니에서 시계를 꺼내 보고 다시 서둘러 가는 것을 보자, 앨리스는 발을 들었습니다. 그녀는 그동안 허리띠 주머니나 그 안에서 시계를 꺼내는 토끼를 본 적이 없다는 생각이 머릿속을 스쳐 지나갔습니다. 그리고 호기심에 불타면서 그녀는 토끼를 따라 들판을 가로질러 달렸고, 토끼가 가로수 아래 큰 토끼굴로 뛰어 들어가는 것을 눈앞에서 보았습니다.

> 이 문구에서 Madeleine이 감탄한 문구은 "she ought to have wondered at this" 라는 문구다. 이런 문구를 구사하는 학생이 있다면, 스마트한 친구라고 생각할 것이라고 하였다.. ㅋㅋㅋ 꿀팁인거 같다. ought to 는 should와 같은 의미라고 한다. 그리고 엘리스는 본격적으로 꿈에 빠져들었다는 것을 알 수 있다.

**English**: In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.

**Korean**: 그 다음 순간에 앨리스는 토끼를 따라서 굴 속으로 떨어져 들어갔습니다. 그녀는 단 한 번도 이런 상황에서 어떻게 다시 나올 수 있을지에 대해 고려해본 적이 없었습니다.

**English**: The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down what seemed to be a very deep well.

**Korean**:

**English**: Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her, and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything: then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and bookshelves: here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled "ORANGE MARMALADE," but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.

**English**: "Well!" thought Alice to herself, "after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!" (Which was very likely true.)

**Korean**:

**English**: Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end? "I wonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?" she said aloud. "I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles donw, I think--" (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of the sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) "--yes, that's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I've got to?" (Alice had not the slightest idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but she thought they were nice grand words to say.)

**Korean**:

**English**: Presently she began again. "I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downwards! The Antipathies, I think--" (she was rather glad there was no one listening, this time, as it didn't sound at all the right word) "--but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?" (and she tried to curtsey as the spoke-fancy curtseying as you're falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) "And what an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere."

**Korean**:

**English**: Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. “Dinah ’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think !” (Dinah was the cat.) “ I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah, my dear! I wish you were down here with me ! There are no mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?” And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, “Do cats eat bats ? Do cats eat bats ?” and sometimes, “Do bats eat cats?” for, you see, as she couldn’t answer either question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and was saying to her very earnestly, “Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat ?” when suddenly, thump ! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.
